## Angle Finder
With the inclusion of Machine Learning with opencv, we have been able to unlock the potentials of our algorithms to derive useful informations from images, videos and graphic images. One of the various attributes that can be explored is angle at which the object is kept. We can achieve this if we know the specifications of the lens of the camera. We can with the help of a little maths, predict what the angle of the 2D object. 

### DATASET
I was provided with image and I used it to predict the angle of the object in clockwise direction in the provided image and we were also given a video from which we can extract out the frames and predict the angle of the given object in image.

### APPROACH
We have employed opencv module for the scanning of the images and to capture the angle of the image provided. The lens of the camera(in this case, it is the webcam) , provided us with the image from the lens of the camera. And then , we would just measure the angle of the object in image as it is in image, and finally using both of them, we would be able to predict the angle of the object.

### FUTURE SCOPE
With this use of OpenCV, one can easily detect the potential size of an object, which has huge applications in the field of medical sciences where our model can predict whether there is some angle difference in the joints or other damaged parts of the body. The same can be used for the detection of tumor or moles inside the skin or body of the patient. The uses can be further extended to meteorological uses like predicitng the angle with which an incoming meteor or the debris falling from space. The model can have varied uses and the scope of the model is vast and ever-increasing
